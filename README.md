# Diabetes-Model
Welcome to the Diabetes Tracking Model repository. This project provides a machine learning model to predict and track diabetes-related information.

## About

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook where been developed a machine learning model for diabetes tracking. 
The model uses various features  as below to predict and track diabetes-related information:
1. Pregnancies
2. Gluclose level
3. Blood Pressure
4. Skin Thckness
5. Insulin level
6. BMI
7. Diabetes Pedigree Function
8. Age
